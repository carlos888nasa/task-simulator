# 🧩 Task Simulator & Scheduler

This project is a task management simulator (mini-scheduler) written in Java.
Its primary goal is to apply advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, clean design, and layered architecture, focusing entirely on core logic rather than GUI distractions.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The system is designed with a strict separation of concerns (Layered Architecture):

* **Model**: Pure representation of data and state (Tasks, Status, Priorities).
* **Service**: The core engine. Contains business rules, validation, and scheduling logic.
* **Controller**: The intermediary that orchestrates communication between the UI and the underlying logic.
* **UI**: Console-based user interface.
* **Exceptions**: Custom domain-specific error handling.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Build System:** Maven
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## 🧠 Core Concepts Applied

* Encapsulation and Domain Defense.
* Polymorphism and Interfaces.
* Java Collections Framework (`ArrayList`, `PriorityQueue`).
* Clean Exception Handling.
